# ---= monocore typeface =---

(Still in progress, not ready to show or try yet.)

## objectives
* minimalist (ala 'muli' or 'aaargh' and of course classic frutiger-based)
* good monospace densities ala inconsolata, consolas
* probably a bit thinner than many monospace typefaces

(geek-sensitive)
* good character distinction, ala monaco, menlo, inconsolata
* good alignment for pseudo-box characters
* clearly distinguished punctuation that's simultaneously less dense than
  normal
* same width - even a singlewidth version of double-wide unicode characters
* see if it can look as good as inconsolata, monaco, etc...
